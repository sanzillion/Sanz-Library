My own collection of codes

My memory is kinda awful, but I am nevertheless thankful with it.
And I often found myself to be digging for codes from my previous
work, so the files in here serves as my reference guide of all
the codes I might be constantly needing in the future projects.
It lessens the time of my remembering and browsing the folders
and pages on my workstation.
